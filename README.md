## About the Project 
This is an e-commerce virtual AR and physical products web application. The initial idea stemmed from one of my trips to Beacon Town, New York. I've always been fascinated by the Western magical world, psychic culture, astrology, natural herbs, and healing. I experienced mental breakdowns twice, which drove me to start seeking some natural healing methods.

I hold the belief that within the vastness of the universe, humans are insignificantly small. I also believe that every entity, from a humble plant to a solitary stone, harbors life and possesses the ability to generate energy and engage with the universe.
